My friend Nguyen is starting up a new business producing chili oil sauce and
gave me a few prototype samples to try. This sauce is similar to the kind that
you find in a lot of Chinese cuisines. The main difference and draw are the
crispy bits of garlic and shallots. Hence the name, Chili Crisps.

Submitted by lynn on 08/10/2020 - 6:10pm.

My foodie friends had mentioned The French Oven Bakery & Cafe a few times and
I finally had a chance to try it this summer! This small shop is located in
the Scripps Ranch area of San Diego and provides social distancing through
limiting customers in store and 6 feet markers on the ground.

Our first takeout was in early July. Dennis participated in the virtual
version of the annual Scripps Ranch Old Pros bike / fun run event and claimed
a free pastry offer from here plus brought home a few treats for me to try.

It's been a few months since our last foodie event, which happened to be a
wonderful weekend of chocolate, food, wine and spirits at Pechanga Resort &
Casino. We thought it would be nice to reminisce by sharing our photo
highlights! Below is the Chocolate Decadence event. Make sure to check out the
Wine Festival event as well!

## Chocolate Decadence

This event featured more than 30 wine varietals that pair with chocolate and
other sweet desserts. Included in admission was a souvenir wine glass,
unlimited two ounce samples of wine and spirits, gourmet dessert samples from
Pechanga’s acclaimed pastry chefs, live music and silent auction. This year's
event was the 12th annual event and was held on Friday, March 6, 2020 from
7-10pm (general admission).

restaurants such as Powerhaus Wholesome Pizza & Eats. We were invited to check

eatery in our area is Boss Bird Kitchen on Miramar Rd. They took over the spot
where Gaya Gaya once was, and Sarap Kitchen before that! Foodie friend Mary

lunch service back in February, when dining in was still the norm. There is
also a revisit, takeout style, in the second half of this post.

grilled over charcoal, sliced by hand at your table, controlled by a green

Brazilian drink Caipirinha, get an insider view of their kitchen, then feast
once again on their food! Read on for details on our recent visit!

of the ocean!

Seriously, what could be grander than food with a view? From one side of the
restaurant patio, you can see the San Diego downtown skyline and from the
other side, you can see the Coronado bridge. Peohe's is next to the Coronado
Ferry Landing, has free parking (yay), and presents an elegant atmosphere with

It's been _years_ since I went site-seeing in Washington D.C. Does a seventh
grade field trip really count if I don't remember where I went? Since it was
only 1 hour away from Columbia, MD, the weekend was reserved for the famed
District of **Columbia** , i.e. Washington D.C. My plan was to explore the
National Mall area and take photos of monuments and memorials I found through
google maps. A little after 7am, I paid for 3 hours of parking on Ohio Dr SW
near Franklin Roosevelt Memorial.

I hustled over to the famous **Lincoln Memorial** for a look at Honest Abe,
our 16th US president. Since it was still early, few people were in front of
the building such as a grad student taking pics with their family. You can
already see some harsh morning light shining through onto the statue.
